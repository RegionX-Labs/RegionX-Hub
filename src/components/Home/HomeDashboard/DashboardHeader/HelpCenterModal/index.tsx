This view provides a high-level summary of all Coretime related activity. It's designed to give you an overview of the entire Coretime system: 

- Which cores are renewable this cycle
- The cost efficiency of renewal vs. new purchases
- Insight into the current sale cycle auction
- A history of purchases and renewals

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use this dashboard to get an overview of the entire system. If you want to register a new project or manage an existing one, use the appropriate dashboard.`,

      text: `**Renewable Cores Panel**

This section lists all cores that are eligible for renewal during the current sale cycle. Each item includes:

- Para ID
- Time remaining until the renewal window closes
- The renewal cost in real time

If you can't find your project here, it is either not eligible for renewal or it has already renewed for the current sale cycle. To check its status, go to the '**Managing Existing Project**' dashboard and view the overview of your parachain.


ðŸ’¡ Tip: Renew during the **interlude phase**. Renewals attempted later are not guaranteed to succeed if all cores are sold.`,

      text: `**Renewal vs New Core Price Comparison**

This section helps you decide whether to renew a core or purchase a new one based on current pricing:

- Shows the **current auction price** for new cores
- Shows the **renewal price** determined by the previous sale cycle
- Highlights if renewal is cheaper, equal, or more expensive

ðŸ’¡ Tip:  Even if purchasing a new core is cheaper, there is a risk involved, as all cores can sell out quickly and you may end up without one.`,

      text: `**Auction Phase Status**

This widget displays the current auction phase and time progress for the ongoing sale cycle.

Phases:
- **Interlude**: Window to submit renewals before the sale starts.
- **Leadin**: Sale starts and core price decreases block-by-block
- **Fixed Price**: End period of the sale â€” the price is at its lowest point.

The visual ring shows:
- Progress through the current phase
- When the next phase begins

    {
      text: `**Sale Cycle Chart**

This graph shows how core prices change over time during the Dutch auction cycle. The auction is divided into the **interlude**, **leadin**, and **fixed price** phases.

Overview:

- **Y-axis**: price in the relay chain currency.
- **X-axis**: block timeline from start to end of the sale cycle.

During the **Interlude** only renewals can be submitted. After that the auction begins with a high initial price that decreases linearly over the **Leadin** phase. Once the **Fixed Price** phase begins, the price stops decreasing and remains constant.

Use this chart to:
- Identify ideal entry points for core purchases.
- Predict when your target price may be reached.
- Understand historical buying behavior from previous cycles.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Many buyers place bulk orders once prices hit a psychological threshold. If you're waiting too long, you may miss the purchase opportunity  â€” especially in high-demand cycles.

      text: `**Welcome to the dashboard for deploying a new project**

This view offers a simplified overview intended for new projects that want to purchase a core and deploy.

Here users are able to see the price of a new core from bulk sale as well as track the current sale cycle. 

ðŸ“Œ Note: New projects don't have the option to renew, as they don't own a core yet. Therefore, no renewal-related information is shown on this dashboard.

      text: `**Cores Remaining**

This section displays a real-time chart showing how many cores are still available for purchase during the current sale cycle.

The graph updates as purchases occur, with each drop representing a new sale. This lets you visually assess demand and competition over time.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: A steep drop early in the sale signals high demand for Coretime. Once the remaining cores reach zero, the current sale cycle is considered sold out.`,

      text: `**Renewal Info Card**
This section allows you to manage and renew core allocations for your selected parachain.

Here's what you can do:
- Select a parachain from the dropdown to view its status
- Each parachain in the dropdown shows its renewal status (e.g., "Renewed" in green or "Needs Renewal" in red) so you can instantly see if action is required
- See the current state of the parachain (e.g., Active, Idle, Renewable) along with a description of what that means
- If the parachain has the potential to renew, it will display the renewal cost and the deadline to submit the renewal
- Use the **Renew** button to directly initiate a core renewal transaction for the selected parachain

If no core is available for renewal, the Renew button will not appear.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Submitting your renewal during the interlude phase ensures that a core will be allocated to the project. Missing the renewal can result in the project failing to secure a core, leading to stalled block production.`,

- Shows the **calculated renewal price** for your existing cores
- Highlights if renewal is cheaper, equal, or more expensive

ðŸ’¡ Tip:  Even if renewing a core is the more expensive option, it guarantees that the project will have a core. Purchasing from the auction could result in failing to secure one if all cores are sold out before your purchase.`,
