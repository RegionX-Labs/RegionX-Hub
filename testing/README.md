# E2E testing with Chopsticks

With Chopsticks, we can spin up an environment with listed regions and test the interface to ensure everything works correctly.

To run the RegionX chain locally with a simulated environment, run:

```
npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest -c ./testing/chopstick/regionx.yaml
```
